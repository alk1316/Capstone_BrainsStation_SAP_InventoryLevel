# 1. Project Overview

## Introduction
Efficient inventory management is a challenge for many businesses, as maintaining the right stock levels is critical to balance supply and demand. Overstocking can lead to increased holding costs and wasted resources, while stockouts can result in lost sales, poor customer satisfaction, and potential damage to the company’s reputation.

This project aims to develop a predictive model to optimize stock levels using historical sales data from SAP Business One. Efficient inventory management is crucial for businesses to meet customer demand while minimizing holding costs and avoiding overstock or stockouts.

By leveraging SAP Business One USA demo database ten years of invoice data (2006-2016), we will analyze sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product demand to forecast optimal stock levels for each item.

## Business Case
OEC Computers is a company located in the United States, specializing in the purchase and distribution of technological products. With a solid track record in the market, OEC has successfully expanded its operations nationally, as well as to markets in Canada and Europe. Over the years, the company has accumulated sales data from 2006 to 2016, which represents a valuable source of information for understanding market trends and product demand.

## Problem
The lack of accurate demand forecasting can lead to misinformed purchasing and replenishment decisions, creating inefficiencies in the supply chain.

## Objectives
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset, ensuring that it is suitable for predictive analysis by addressing missing data, inconsistencies, and outliers.

2. **Sales Pattern Analysis:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, in sales, which will help in understanding demand behavior.

3. **Model Development:** Use machine learning and time-series forecasting techniques to predict future demand and establish optimal stock levels for the business.

4. **Evaluation and Optimization:** Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics, refine the model to improve accuracy, and provide actionable insights for stock management.

## Expected Outcome:
By the end of the project, we expect to create a predictive tool that will enable the business to optimize its inventory levels, reduce costs, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. The insights gained from this model will support data-driven decision-making and enhance the company’s ability to meet customer demands with more precision.

# 3. Exploration and Preprocessing

In this section, we will proceed with the initial data cleaning process, converting date data to datetime format, transforming object data into numerical values, removing any leading or trailing white spaces, and handling missing values if necessary.

Afterward, we will conduct an exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of the data, sales trends, top-selling products, and more.

By the end of this section, we will have a clearer understanding of the data and which information can be used for our purposes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

As part of the Data Exploration, the following information is analyzed:

- Sales Over Time Analysis

- Customer Analysis

    - Total sales per customer
    - Total sales per customer group
    - Sales evolution over time per customer

- Product Analysis

    - Top-selling products by total sales amount
    - Top-selling products by quantity sold
    - Sales distribution by product group
    - Temporal trends by product and total sales amount

- Correlation Analysis
 <p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

# 4. Modeling Approach

With the goal of projecting the total inventory for the upcoming year 2017, the decision has been made to focus on the top 5 best-selling products based on the quantity sold.

The variables to be used are reviewed, with the dependent variable being the quantity to be sold, and the independent variable being the years.

We will apply the following approaches:

- Projections based on statistical calculations:

    - Simple average calculation
    - Weighted average calculation

- Linear Regression:

Projecting 2017 sales using linear regression, where the independent variable is the years, and the dependent variable is the quantities sold.

- Decision Tree:

Utilizing this model to predict 2017 sales and compare it with the previous models.

 <p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

# 5. Model Development

We will improve the projection models by breaking down the years into months, and to be more precise, we will focus on projecting sales for the first quarter of 2017.

Additionally, we will apply an ARIMA model to compare the differences in the projections.

Finally, we will perform an unsupervised model on the entire original dataset to gain further insights.
