<h2 id="projectoverview">Project Overview</h2>
This project aims to develop a predictive model to optimize stock levels using historical sales data from SAP Business One. Efficient inventory management is crucial for businesses to meet customer demand while minimizing holding costs and avoiding overstock or stockouts.

By leveraging ten years of invoice data (2006-2016), we will analyze sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product demand to forecast optimal stock levels for each item.

By the end of the project, we expect to create a predictive tool that will enable the business to optimize its inventory levels, reduce costs, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. The insights gained from this model will support data-driven decision-making and enhance the company’s ability to meet customer demands with more precision.

<h2 id="problemstatement">Problem Statement</h2>
Efficient inventory management is a challenge for many businesses, as maintaining the right stock levels is critical to balance supply and demand. Overstocking can lead to increased holding costs and wasted resources, while stockouts can result in lost sales, poor customer satisfaction, and potential damage to the company’s reputation.

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset, ensuring that it is suitable for predictive analysis by addressing missing data, inconsistencies, and outliers.

2. Sales Pattern Analysis: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, in sales, which will help in understanding demand behavior.

3. Model Development: Use machine learning and time-series forecasting techniques to predict future demand and establish optimal stock levels for the business.

4. Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics, refine the model to improve accuracy, and provide actionable insights for stock management.

<h2 id="fetureengineering">Feature Engineering</h2>
The key variables used in this model are:

**<li>OpprId:** Unique identifier for each opportunity.</li>
**<li>CardCode:** Customer or lead code.</li>
**<li>CreateDate:** Date when the opportunity was created.</li>
**<li>OpenDate:** The start date of the opportunity.</li>
**<li>CloseDate:** The actual closing date.</li>
**<li>PredDate:** Predicted closing date.</li>
**<li>MaxSumLoc:** Potential amount for the opportunity.</li>
**<li>IntRate:** Interest level of the opportunity.</li>

 <p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<h2 id="modelingapproach">Modeling Approach</h2>
### Logistic Regression (Initial Phase)

**<li>Objective:** Predict whether an opportunity will be won or lost.</li>
**<li>Steps:**</li>
<li>Preprocess the dataset: handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.</li>
<li>Train and validate the logistic regression model using key features such as opportunity creation date, interest level, and predicted close date.</li>
<li>Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.</li>

### Decay Model (Improvement Phase)

**<li>Objective:**  Improve the predictions by weighting key features (e.g., time since last interaction) with a decay function.</li>
**<li>Steps:**</li>
<li>Implement a decay model (e.g., BTYD model) to measure how time without activity affects the probability of losing an opportunity.</li>
<li>Combine the output of the decay model with the logistic regression model to improve predictions.</li>
<li>Re-evaluate the model performance using the same metrics as the initial phase.</li>
 <p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<h2 id="evaluationmetrics">Evaluation Metrics</h2>
<li>Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.</li>
<li>Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.</li>
<li>Recall: The ability of the model to find all the relevant opportunities.</li>
<li>F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.</li>

<h2 id="howrunproject">How to Run the Project</h2>
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Execute the notebook or script to run the logistic regression model.
4. Future Work: Implement the decay model and integrate it with the logistic regression model.
 <p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<h2 id="futureenhancements">Future Enhancements</h2>
- Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for comparison.
- Apply the decay model to weigh variables like time since last interaction and opportunity amount to refine predictions.
- Sentiment Analysis: SAP Business One includes a field for comments, where sales reps log their interactions with clients. In the future, I plan to analyze the sentiment of these comments using a sentiment analysis model. By incorporating this sentiment data into the prediction process, the model could better assess the likelihood of closing or losing an opportunity based on the tone and content of sales interactions.
- Deploy the model as a service to be used in production environments for real-time predictions.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
This project provides an initial machine learning model to predict the probability of success or loss of sales opportunities in SAP Business One. With the planned improvements using decay models, this solution will help sales teams optimize their opportunity management processes and take preventive action to reduce the risk of losing valuable leads.
